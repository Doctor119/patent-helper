    <h3>What is a preliminary search?</h3>
    <p>
        A preliminary search is one to simply get started on your journey to obtaining a patent.
        Obtaining a patent is a process that takes many hours of research, several drafts of a 
        patent application, and possibly many years in the patent prosecution process. Before you
        get started on such a heavy commitment, we recommend you do a preliminary search of the
        patent database to get a quick idea of how novel your invention is.
    </p>
    <p>
        If at the end of this preliminary search you feel hopeful about obtaining a patent for your
        invention, you should consider calling the experts at Lawyer, Lawyer and Associates to begin
        this exciting and prestigious process.
